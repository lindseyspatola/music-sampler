  <p>To me music is supposed to make you feel good, and that is what is what Ben Rector's music does. No matter what mood I'm in, I can turn on his music and it will make my day better. There's variety in his music, some songs are upbeat and fun, some are more mellow and real. He has an honesty in his music, that I feel is very hard to find now a days.</p>

  <p> These four songs below show off Rector's versatility and variety. Each from a different album, these songs showcase his feel-good music style. Rector is a singer-songwriter, and he writes song that anyone can relate too. Out of the four, my personal favorite is fear. He sings about uncertainty and overcoming doubts, and I think this is something that we all have struggled to do at one point.  </P>
